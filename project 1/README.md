### Concept and Theme  
The overall concept of the NYUAD Freshman Guide is to create an intuitive, visually appealing resource that helps freshmen feel welcomed and informed. The theme centers around accessibility, engagement, and community-building. By integrating interactive features like a video guide and slideshow, the aim is to provide both information and a sense of immersion into the NYU Abu Dhabi environment. I wanted to create an experience that was both informative and visually dynamic, giving new students a seamless transition into campus life, while also showcasing key locations and resources. The reason I choose the color purple is becuase its the main color of NYU, this keeps the webiste looking professional. Additionally, I wanted to keep the website simple becuase it's easy for freshmans to navigate.

### Process  
To implement this concept, I began by outlining the essential sections of the website that new students would need, such as maps, a calendar of events, and campus resources. I then focused on creating a simple and clean layout using HTML and CSS for ease of navigation. I added interactive features like the slideshow and video guide using JavaScript to enhance user engagement and make the website more dynamic. The idea was to make sure users could find everything they needed quickly, while also exploring multimedia content.

### Reflection & Evaluation  
Looking back at the original concept, I feel that the expectations and goals were largely met. The website successfully integrates the major elements I aimed for, such as ease of use and interactive features that engage the audience. The visual design aligns with the theme of community-building and accessibility. There are still a few features I would like to add, such as the student blog section and FAQs, but overall, the core functionality is effective. Future updates will focus on refining these elements and expanding the content to meet the evolving needs of freshmen.
